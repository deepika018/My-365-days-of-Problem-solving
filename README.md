# 365 Days of Problem Solving in Java 🚀

## Introduction
Welcome to my **365 Days of Problem Solving in Java** challenge! 🎯 This is a year-long commitment to improving my problem-solving skills by solving at least one problem every day in Java. This journey aims to enhance my coding skills, strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures, and prepare for coding interviews.

## Goals 🎯
- Solve **one problem per day** for 365 days.
- Improve proficiency in **Java programming**.
- Strengthen **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts.
- Enhance problem-solving speed and accuracy.
- Prepare for **coding interviews and competitive programming**.
